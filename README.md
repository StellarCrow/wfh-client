## Setup 

Firstly, we need to mention that our app has two modules: [Front-end](https://github.com/StellarCrow/wfh-client) and [Back-end](https://github.com/StellarCrow/wfh-backend). It doesn't matter which one You start off with, just don't forget to setup the second part.

Now, my friend, let's setup the Front-end part of the game:

If You've already gone through installing the Back-end part, you can skip the first 3 points and go straight to cloning the project.

- Run `node -v` in console and make sure your version of Node.js is above `v8.11.3`
- Run `npm -v` in console and make sure your version of npm is above `5.6.0`
- Run `git --version`in console and make sure your version of Git is above `2.18.0`
- Clone this project: `git clone https://github.com/StellarCrow/wfh-client`
- Change directory to directory of the project `cd wfh-client`
- Change branch to develop `git checkout develop`
- Run `npm install` to install the dependencies
- Run `ng serve --o` to start the project
- Voilà! If You've already installed the [Back-end](https://github.com/StellarCrow/wfh-backend) part, please enjoy the project. Otherwise, head on to the [next setup section.](https://github.com/StellarCrow/wfh-backend)
